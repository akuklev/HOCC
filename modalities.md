# Overview

In 2016 C. McBride [introduced](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30936-1_12) graded type theories with exact control over the number of computationally relevant argument usages. Original version used three modes, but can be extended to the following five:
```
x : X -- as often as desired
x :⁻X -- use at most once
x :¹X -- use exactly most once
x :⁺X -- use at least once
x :⁰X -- virtual argument, use only in type annotations
```

In intutionistic type theories, negation `¬T` is encoded as the function type `T → ⊥`. A proof that requires an assumption `nT : ¬T` can employ
this assumption to cut excluded cases when performing case analysis. For instance, a value `v : P + T` can be matched by `{ inl(p) ↦ ... ; inr(t) ↦ nT(t) }`.
Due to ex-falso-quodlibet (the recursion operator of the empty type ⊥), the excluded branch `nT(t)` can typecheck against any type.

Proofs by contradiction assume a negative premise `nT : ¬T` to derive a contradiction `⊥`. One way to arrive at a contradiction is to construct a counter-example `t : T` and feed it into `nT(t)` thus yielding a contradiction. In general, a proof can require multiple negative premises, and use only one of them, so it is not guaranteed that every negative premise is used. On the other hand, such a premise can be used inside an internal recursive subproof to cut branches, so it can be used unbounded number of times. However, if we require such a premise to be used exactly once, we can extract a counterexample from a proof by contradiction:
```
 prf : ¬(nT :¹¬T)
——————————————————
   εᵀ(prf) : T
```

Otherwise, the extraction will be non-determinstic. However, we can introduce modalities of spectra ◇⁺, ♢⁻ and ♢, meaning “one or more possible outcome”, ”one or less outcomes” and “any number of possible outcomes”. With this modalities we have:
```
 prf : ¬(nT :⁺¬T)      prf : ¬(nT :⁻¬T)        prf : ¬¬T
——————————————————    ——————————————————    ——————————————
  εᵀ(prf) : ◇⁺T         εᵀ(prf) : ◇⁻T        εᵀ(prf) : ◇T
```

For the rest of this paper will not consider the substructural modes (⁻, ¹, ⁺) and modal operators (◇⁺, ◇⁻), and only consider the truly remarkable third rule above. It's the classical choice operator, which means we can presummably use classical reasoning (with excluded middle and choice) under the ◇-modality!  `◇T` is the type of hypothetically possible inhabitants of `T`, yet will argue that it has a sound computational interpretation in terms of the Verse Calculus recently introduced by S. Peyton Jones et al. We will also introduce the dual types `□T` of “manifestly neccesary” inhabitants of `T`, i.e. closed terms, yielding the well-known computational interpretation in terms of staged computability. Dually to classical reasoning under ◇-modality, we obtain parametric reasoning under □-modality, so that we can show that `{ x ↦ x }` in the only canonical endomorphism of an arbitrary type up to equivalence: `∀(id : □∀(T : *) T → T) id ≃ { x ↦ x }`.

By establishing a set-theoretic interpretation of types under ◇-modality, we will show admissibility of the following rule that allows using closed non-constructive proofs as virtual arguments outside of the ◇-context:
```
 f : (x :° X) → Y      x : □◇X
———————————————————————————————
          f(x) : Y
```

We will show that this rule implies (and essentially is) the computational Markov principle allowing to evaluate (potentially diverging by virtue of halting problem) computations given a closed classical proof of their non-divergence: 
```
 c : (Computation T)   nonDivergencePrf : □◇(c ≠ ⊥)
————————————————————————————————————————————————————
          eval(c, nonDivergencePrf) : T
```

We will show that even in presence computational of Markov principle, all explicitly definable functions `f : □(X → Y)` are continuous with respect to the topology given by positively semi-decidable predicates which is also the usual open-ball topology for all types constructed as Cauchy completions.

In presence of °- and □-modality it is possible to introduce a reflective virtial universe 𝕊 and postulate existence of ordinary universes closed under any finite number of closed-definable type formers, yielding a type-theoretic counterpart (and pressumably an equiconsistent conservative extension) of M. Shulman's “Set theory for category theory” ZMC/𝕊. These features make the proposed system an optimal foundation for a proof assistaint. For practical usability as a functional programming language, the system has to be extended with indexed modalities for size-guarded recursion and clock-guarded corecursion, which are known to be eliminable towards of ordinary recursion and corecursion at cost of substantial complexity blowup.

In a [companion paper](reedy-types), we outline how to extend Martin-Löf type theories including the one proposed in this paper to allow structural induction over their own languages, extending the notion of types from ∞-groupoids to ω-categories as a natural by-product.

# The Markov principle

# Unary parametricity

# Interpreting classical logic

# Interpreting verse calculus

Verse calculus is a functional logic programming language, which implies that a closed “program” can be evaluated:
```
         prgm : □◇P
————————————————————————————————
 eval(prgm) : PolyComputation P
```

Where PolyComputation is a monad similar to the Computation monad, but allowing to yield multiple, potentially infinutely many values, a computational stream modulo order and multiplicity of values.

Such “eval“ operator gives the “all” operator of Verse Calculus, while εᵀ gives “one” operator.

# Reflective universes

# Embedding of the type-theoretic model of ZF-sets into ◇ by Zakharyaschev subframe canonical formulae

# Set-theoretic model a la Pujet-Tabareau and conservativity via back-and-fourth argument

# Normalization for the modal-free fragment and admissibility of Markov principle

# Future work: Canonicity for the □-fragment, productivity for the ◇-fragment

The former means that the “stream” `eval(prgm : □◇P)` is dense in the spectrum `◇P` with respect to the topology given by positively semi-decidable predicates.
