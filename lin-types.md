Linear Dependent Types, Eventual Consistency, and Entanglement
==============================================================

In present document I will sketch how to extend the Higher Observational Construction Calculus
HOCC by single-use variables and types for them.

§ Request Endpoints, Continuations, and Sessions
------------------------------------------------


Assume you use HOCC as a functional programming language and seek to go beyond functions that just
calculate. You want to write down procedures that interact with external entities called objects or
actors. From now on we will be calling the types available in HOCC value types, because we'll be
introducing adding a new kind of types: the interfaces, which are types of actors and objects. In
this setting user interaction will be also modelled as interaction with an actor of specified
interface but of unknown and unknowable internals.

Interaction can be implemented by performing requests and calculating with their results. For any
to value types `ReqT : 𝓤` and `RespT : 𝓤` there will be an object interface `ReqT ⊸ RespT`
describing request endpoints. A request endpoint `f : ReqT ⊸ RespT` can be used as you would
normally use a function,
```
let response = f(request)
```

But there is one caveat: the varable `f : ReqT ⊸ RespT` is a single use variable, it can be used
only once and it should be used at least once to avoid a dangling object. Continuations constitute
a form of request endpoint, and you don't want to have dangling continuations.

A procedure anticipating continuation has the following signature:
```
proc(normal-args : X)[\T](\cont : R ⊸ T) : T

 equaivalently

proc : Π(\normal-args : X) ⋂(\T) (R ⊸ T) ⊸ T
```

Certainly, response types can be dependent on request types:
```
 ReqT : 𝓤   (r : ReqT) ⊢ RespT(r)
-----------------------------------
    (\r : ReqT) ⊸ RespT(r) : 𝓛
```

For request endpoints that are not mandatory to use, one can use a special request to close them.
You just wrap `ReqT` into a type with additional request `Terminate`, and wrap the type `RespT`
into a type with additional responce `Terminated` which arizes iff the request was to close the
endpoint:
```
#Inductive OptionalRec[ReqT : *] : *
  Request(\r : T)
  Terminate

#Inductive Resp[RespT : ReqT → *] : OptionalRec[ReqT] → *
  Terminate ↦ Terminated
  Request(\req) ↦ Response(\resp : ReqT(req))

now instead of `f : (\r : ReqT) ⊸ RespT(r)` you can
use `f : (\r : OptionalRec(ReqT)) ⊸ Resp[RespT](r)`
to have a closable request endpoint.
```

An endpoint can return another endpoints. For example, consider the following interface:
```
random-number-generator : (\n : ℕ) ⊸ (𝟙 ⊸ Fin(100))^n
```

Given a natural number `n` it generates `n` independent endpoints, each of them has a trivial
request type (the type `𝟙` with the single inhabitant `() : 𝟙`, and returns a number between 0
and 99 when invoked).

Endpoint factory has the type `!I`. It produces any number of independent endpoints of identical
interface. A variable of a type `x : !I` is not single-use any more, it is allowed to be used
any number of times. For value types `A` and `B`, the types `A → B` and `!A ⊸ B` are equivalent.

By returning a single endpoint as part of the responce, endpoints can represent communication
streams. If an endpoint has a type `I` with property `I = (\r : ReqT) ⊸ I × RespT(r)`, an endpoint
`s : I` can be used as follows:
```
#let (s₂, response₁) := s(request₁)
#let (s₃, response₂) := s₂(request₂)
...
```

Since each `sₙ` has the same name and the previous one is already consumed, one can actually
suppress induces. Then we could write code like this:
```
#let (console, _)    := console(Print("Please, enter your name: "))
#let (console, name) := console(GetString)
#let (console, _)    := console(Print("Hello, [name]!"))
```

Since there is no way to close the running endpoint, at the end of such a procedure you just return
`console` back to the caller.

In general interface of the returned endpoint could also change. Assume we have the type “State”,
the types `ReqT(\s : State)` and `RespT(\s : State)(\req : Req(s))` now depend on the state of
the endpoint, and we have the function `next-state(\s : State, \r : ReqT(s)) : State`. Now we
can define the type `I(\s : State)` with the property
```
I(s) = (\r : ReqT(s)) ⊸ I(next-state(s, r)) × RespT(s)(r)
```

Such types are called session types. One also allow an endpoint to return multiple fresh endpoints
or no endpoint at all closing the communication. With this generalization we obtain the linear
counterpart of coinductive types. As coinductive types can be generalized to Equaliser Coinductive
Types (the dual of Quotient Inductive Types) by equational conditions, session types can be
generalized by conditions in terms of string diagrams (the linear counterpart of equations).
These string diagrams specify required indepencence structure of returned endpoints, and as well
as the eventual consistency structure. In other words, these are the rules specifying allowed out
of order execution of requests.

§ Actors and Objects
--------------------

In general interfaces classify actors. Actors may be nondetermenistic and communicate with each
other. That is, result of a particular request to one remote database might depend on the fact
that we previously requested another remote database, because they cound have communicated
behind the scenes. Objects are self-enclosed, requests to them are independent of any requests
to the other objects. Yet, objects may be non-determinisitc (e.g. a random number generator)
and might be in a state of quantum entanglement with other objects (e.g. two single-use random
bit generators might be guaranteed to produce opposite results without without communicating
and without being determinisitc). Deterministic objects are the ones that can be programmed
in plain HOTT. They are nothing but deterministic state machines inside. Given a value `x : X`
we can upcast it into an object returning such a value `⁅x⁆ : 𝟙 ⊸ X`. For any session type `I`
and any instance of its coinductive counterpart, we have an analogous upcast operation.

(Some coinductive types may require independence and eventual consistency conditions that are
algebraically admissible but not satifiable by any determinisitc object. This is precisely the
case when quantum entanglement is described. Entangled objects can provide eventual consistency
without any communication.)

For objects, ownership is a great concept. Being self-enclosed, they can be seen as having
a single owner who completely controlls them. It does not make much sense for actors though.

§ Operators on Interfaces
-------------------------

For two values types `T Q : 𝓤` one can build their cartesian product `T × Q` containing pairs
`(t, q)` of values `t : T` and `q : Q`. We can also build dependent pair types `Σ(\t : T) Q(t)`.

This trivially generalizes to the case when `Q : 𝓛` is an interface type. It allows to define
disjunctive sum of two interfaces `Q ⊕ P := Σ(\t : 𝔹) (ff ↦ Q, tt ↦ P)`. That is, an actor of
type `Q ⊕ P` is either of type `Q` or of type `P`. Now what about cartesian product of two
interfaces? There, we have to options:
* Conjunctive product, i.e. simultaneous occurrence of objects `(q, p) : Q ⊗ P`, there can and must
use both `q` and `p`;
* Disjunctive product, i.e. alternative occurrence of objects `w : Q & P` controlled by the consumer.
The consumer either consumes `w` by `w(ff) : Q` or by `w(tt) : P`, but not both, because one cannot
consume an object twice.

Here binary connectives can be as well generalized to quantifiers where bounded variable is of
a value type.
* `∀(\t : T) Q(t)` denotes a family of objects (each one has to be consumed exactly once);
* `Π(\t : T) Q(t)` denotes a factory that yields one object of the type `Q(t)` when given a `t`.

The operators `⊕`, `⊗`, `&` and `⊸` precisely reproduce the rules of Intuitionistic Linear Logic.
See “Linear Logic Propositions as Session Types” by L. Caires, F. Pfenning, and B. Toninho to see
to complete calculus including constructors how to define particular processes and interactions.
There you will find a calculus where one can spawn new processes/actors, pass messages and
continuations, etc.

Yet, there is some assymetry: we have only three quantifiers instead of four. Normally,
definitions of linear logic use the conjunctive sum `⅋` instead of `⊸`. Two operators are
interdefinable by `X ⊸ Y = X⟂ ⅋ Y`, `X⟂ ⅋ Y = X⟂ ⊸ Y = Y⟂ ⊸ X`, and linear implication is far
easier to understand. Yet only the conjunctive sum can be generalized to a quantifier by
virtue of being commutative and associative.

An object of the type `w : ⅋(\t : T) Q(t)` requires the program to process all branches (as many as
there are values `t` in `T`), with each branch consuming exactly one object `wₜ : Q(q)`. The type
`X ⅋ Y` represents a superposition of `X` and `Y`. It represents a “pool” where two actors are
running simultaneously, concurrently and interacting with each other. If one of the actors has
type `Y = A ⊸ B`, it means it currently awaits a value of the type `A` and not running, which
can lead to the actor `X` being stuck. The handler of `X ⅋ Y` is knows how to process both actors
independently, so it will feed a value of the type `A` into the actor `Y`, so that `X` can go on,
and eventually its result will be also processed by the handler of `X ⅋ Y`.

In the variant of our theory supporting quantum computations, the quantifiers ∀ and ⅋ obtain a very
special meaning. Let `𝔔` denote the interface of (possibly entangled) qbits. Then by
`∀(_ : Fin(n)) 𝔔` we can describe a quantum register of $n$ qubits, and by `⅋(_ : S) 𝔔` a spin-½
particle on the space `S`. Quantifiers over linear types would correspond to definitions of a
particle over a quantum spacetime and that of a field over a quantum spacetime, both of which
are currently underdeveloped.

In type theory there is still one typeformer we have not mentioned yet: the equality. As with
all other typeformers, this one will split into two duals: independence and eventual consistency.

<!--
§ Pool of Actors: Coroutines and Continuations
----------------------------------------------

In the usual HOTT, our judgements have asymmetric form:
```
x : X,..., y : Y ⊢ expr : T
```

We have bag of variables called context on the left and a single expression on the right.
In the concurrent setting, our “programm“ is not a single expression, but a pool of interacting
actors, each one if its type:

```
x : X,..., z : Z ⊢ actor₁ : A,..., actorₙ : Q
```

We'll have a rule to “garbage collect” the actors that have done their job and returned the
value of type `𝟙` (that contains no information). Others, who returned a value, remain there.

In this formalism, there is an alternative to lambda abstraction for linear terms. On one, we
have the rule
```
 I : 𝓛    Γ, c : I ⊢ expr : J (expr uses c exactly once), Δ
-------------------------------------------------------------
            Γ ⊢ (\c : I ↦ expr) : (I ⊸ J), Δ
```

But we have an alternative abstraction:
```
 I : 𝓛    Γ, c : I ⊢ expr : J (expr uses c exactly once), Δ
-------------------------------------------------------------
        Γ ⊢ expr : J, (/c : I) : I ⊸ 𝟙, Δ
```

Now on the right side we have a pool of actors:
The first one, `expr`, is stuck: it awaits the “promise” called `c` of the type `I` to be
satisfied. Another actor, `(/c)` expects a value of the type `I`. Once it is applied to
such a value, it would fulfill the promise named `c` by this value, finish and be
“garbage collected” from the pool of actors.

§§ CPS Reversal
----------------

Assume we have a procedure anticipating a continuation:
```
proc[\T](\cont : R ⊸ T) : T
```

How can the caller extract the result which is not returned, but pushed into the continuation?
That's easy. We just pass `(/c : I)` as a continuation, and use the variable `c` elsewhere.
When `proc` invokes the continuation, it would just fulfill the promise `c` unstucking the
computation involving `c`.

§§ Spawning new Processes
-------------------------

To spawn a process you have to provide a process handle it will go by. Of course, you can spawn
processes recursively, or spawn a whole family of processes at once, but unless you spawn a
process factory, you have to put handles somewhere because they are single-use variables.

Let's translate
```
!print "Hello world"
spawn some-long-computation(args, callback: \result ↦ {
  !print result
})
do-something-else
```

Result:
```
#let (console, _) := console(Print("Hello world")
#let (console, subconsole) := console(CreateSubprocessConsole)
(/deferred-calculation)(
  some-long-computation(args,
    \result ↦
    #let (subconsole, _) subconsole(Print(result))
    subconsole(Close)
  )
)
do-something-else
```

§§ Algebraic effects
--------------------

Invoking single-use algebraic effects can be seen as calls to the handlers being actors in
the pool. Consider the following procedure
```
store(2)
...
#let n := get-from-store
```


To make it work, it is sufficient to have the following in the pool:
```
(/store)(\n ↦ (/get-from-store)(n))
```
