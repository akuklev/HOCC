## Biconstructive logic and Chu spaces

Classical logic allows proofs involving double negation elimination and choice. Constructive logic limits application of those proof techniques so as to guarantee that the notion of existence is effective. That is, given a constructive proof of existence `pf : ‚àÉ(x : T) P(x)` it is possible to construct such an `x` satisfying `P(x)` algorithmically. It is possible limit proof techniques even more to ensure that a proof of non-universality `pf : ¬¨‚àÄ(x : T) P(x)` allows to algorithmically extract a counterexample `x` satisfying `¬¨P(x)`. Such a restriction could be called biconstructive logic and is only possible in presence of substructural types, see .

The universe `Chu` of biconstructive propositions turns out embrace peculiar cases of predicates (describing interacting non-deterministic automata)
which are nither connected by an implication, nor orthogonal. Such propositions satisfy Heisenbergian uncertainty principles, making them appear as if they would describe quantum systems. Yet, the non-deterministically interacting automata do not exhibit any real quantum behaviour as long as we assume them to have fixed states that can be measured simultaneously. If we take relativity of simultaneity (Einsteins relativity) into account, it turns out they _could_ exhibit genuinely quantum behaviour: a mathematically possible state of mutual interdependency of two interacting non-determinisitc automata, which cannot be physically prepared and is inconsistent with the assumption that both systems have a fixed internal state simultaneously.

## Quantum computing, quantum systems, and quantum logic

Entanglement in the sense of Verse Calculus/‚óá-modality is a perceived behavior emerging from the properties of underlying computational system that performs backtracking to find solutions to a set of constraints. It can only emerge where backtracking is available, and thus is incompatible with interactions as these are not reversible/undoable.

By making a wild conjecture that we can have arenas where interactions are somehow compatible with entanglement, we obtain a system where the impossible states from the previous section are attainable. We conjecture, that the resulting formalizm has a ‚Äúcomputational‚Äù interpretation in the terms of quantum computation. We conjecture, that the resulting formalizm is a suitable dependently typed programming language for quantum computers, the spaces of the Chu-predicates on objects being the inner-product vector spaces of their quantum states.

We'll discuss how arenas allow describing interactive/interacting quantum systems and quantum fields, how the respective trace algebras turn into C*-algebras of those systems/fields, and how the combination of the separation logic generated by those C*-algebras and the notion of biconstructive proofs could shed some light on the nature of quantum reality.

We can also think about trace algebras over some rig R which is neither booleans, nor the complex numbers. Given an arena with a trace algebra over the rig
R, let us write down its nondeterministic states as `x : ‚óá·¥øT`. The types `‚óá·¥øT` can be understood as spectra over R, and R can be a generalized rig, that is algebras over the sphere spectrum, with ùîΩ‚ÇÅ being the initial generalized ring. For `R = ùîΩ‚ÇÅ`, the type `‚óá·¥øT = T`. Connections to the absolute geometry (Connes) and to the type theory of parametrized spectra should be studied.


## Dialectica type theory: A size-graded type theory with internal ‚àÇ

It should be possible to develop a resource-aware (hopefully non-G√∂delian) variant of non-interactive HCCC,
where only size-non-increasing functions on sized types can be shown to exist unconditionally. All the other
functions can be only shown to exist conditionally on the availability of enough ‚Äúcomputational budget‚Äù, with
their derivatives (computed by an internal Dialectica translation ‚àÇ) describing how much computational budged they
need for arguments of given size.

It might turn out to be possible to provide a translation of this type theory into the self-verifying
Pakhomov set theory. It might be possible to provide an understanding of this type theory as a type theory
of Diophantine equations.
